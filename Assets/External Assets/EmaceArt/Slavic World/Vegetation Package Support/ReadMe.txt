Attention! I recommend doing backup of your project before instalation.The newest version of Slavica includes completely changed plants like bushes, flowers or grass. If you don’t like the new design, you can get the previous version by installing pack Plants_old. The pack includes models, prefabs and textures in the older version.

Please let me know by e-mail if you want Slavica in Unity 2019 version with HDRP. If there is a huge interest, I’ll release such version.
